# Logic Builder excercise in SolidJS

This is a solution to the Logic builder excercise shown by [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wdVBpLh-Y4) in his video. It doesn't have the full scope implemented (AND/ORs are only binary) but it is enough to understand how all pieces fit together.

It uses Solid's stores to handle nested state. The application is generated by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com) and deployed to [Vercel's edge functions](https://vercel.com).

You can check it out at [https://logic-builder-solid.vercel.app/logic](https://logic-builder-solid.vercel.app/logic).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
